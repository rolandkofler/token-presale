## Sikoba Bounty Program

The Sikoba presale is a seed program for the future sikoba token. Because Sikoba is early stage only a modest amount of money (hundred thousands of Euros, US Dollars) is required to fund the next steps.

>Follow these steps for deployment https://github.com/sikoba/token-presale/blob/master/contracts/SikobaPresale.sol#L83

The bounty program will be exercised on the commiteth.com platform by Status.im.

The bounties are:

-  1.40 ETH,     ~50 EUR Minor bug found
-  8.50 ETH,   ~300 EUR Major bug
- 28.50 ETH, **~1000 EUR + 2% of the successful Presale** for a severe bug found

### Terminology

- severe - the functionality does not work in main area 
- major - the functionality does not work but not in main area (business can be provided)
- minor - there are functional problems but in area which is not affecting the proper execution


Because commiteth itself is in beta and deployed on the testnet we mirror the rewarded addresses on testnet and on mainnet. While the bounty winner receives some test ether through the commiteth platform, the mainnet reward will be sent to the same address. One has to mention that Bountyhunters are advised to create their a own address for the hunt and take care that the private key is not leaked, just because it contains both testnet and mainnet Ether.

Most of the rules on https://blog.gnosis.pm/gnosis-bug-bounty-program-ce568bf4b65c#.5f9hx4kb6 and https://bounty.ethereum.org apply. For example: First come, first serve. Issues that have already been submitted by another user or are already known (such as these) to the team are not eligible for bounty rewards.

Please provide a clear description of the bug, the expected behavior and the actual behavior.
Scope of Sikoba Bug Bounty Program
Within scope are all solidity and EVM related exploits

## Submission deadline
The official bug bounty ends on the day the presale contract is deployed on mainnet. 

Even then major and severe bugs will be rewarded, but you have to contact sikoba in private over a secure channel.
